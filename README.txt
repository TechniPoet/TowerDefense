Project: Tower Defense game

Group members: Sean Goodwin, Ben Levine, Tom Rinaldo, Jeff Robbins


Summary:
Our game is a tower defense game modeled after games such as Kingdom Rush.  The goal is for the player to prevent enemies from reaching the end of a path by defeating them.  They can do this by spending gold to build towers along the path that damage, slow, or spawn obstacles for the enemies.
